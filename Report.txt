Project Report: Intent Detection and advice generation for a Fitness Assistant Using NLP

1. Overview

This project focuses on building a natural language processing (NLP) model to support a fitness assistant application. The primary goal is to identify user intent from free-form text and route the input to the appropriate logic module. The system recognizes three types of intent: `Ask Advice`, `Store Log`, and `User Profile`.

These intents correspond to three key user tasks:

- Receiving personalized fitness or nutrition advice
- Logging meals, workouts, or daily fitness activity
- Computing caloric requirements and weight goals based on body metrics

2. Dataset Construction**

To develop a reliable intent classification system, a domain-specific labeled dataset was created by merging and curating three different intent datasets. Each sample was assigned one of the following categories:

Ask Advice: General questions or guidance requests about fitness and wellness.
Store Log: Entries indicating activity logging, such as “I ran 5km today.”
User Profile: Statements involving user metrics or goals, such as height, weight, or a desire to lose/gain weight.

After cleaning and labeling, the final dataset included approximately 2,500 examples, balanced across the three intent types to improve model robustness and generalization.

3. Model Development**

A BERT-based transformer model was fine-tuned for multi-class classification using the Hugging Face `Trainer` API.

Model: `bert-base-uncased`
Objective: Multi-class classification (3 intents)
Metrics: Accuracy and weighted F1 Score

The model showed high performance on the validation split, demonstrating its ability to correctly interpret diverse user queries in the fitness domain.

4. Application Pipeline

The trained intent model was integrated into a larger fitness assistant pipeline that consists of:

Step 1: Input Handling

User submits text input (e.g., “I want to lose 2 kg in 2 months.”)

Step 2: Intent Classification

The BERT model classifies the input as one of the three predefined intent types.

Step 3: Routing Logic

If `Ask Advice`: The query is passed to a pretrained text generation model (Llama 3.2) that outputs health advice.
If `Store Log`: The entry is stored in a log system (planned for future development).
If `User Profile`: The input is parsed, and a custom calorie calculator estimates BMR, TDEE, and recommended daily caloric intake.

5. Tools and Libraries

- Transformers (Hugging Face)
- Datasets (Hugging Face)
- Scikit-learn
- Torch (PyTorch)
- Pandas, NumPy
- Regex for natural language parsing

6. Data Sources

A custom-curated CSV file: `intent_data_ad_log_pro.csv`
Contains labeled text inputs for `advice`, `log`, and `profile` intents

7. Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the power of NLP in interpreting natural language for a fitness assistant by combining transfer learning with structured logic, the assistant can understand user goals and provide intelligent responses. Future development will include:

- Chatbot integration
- User profile logging and history
- Integration with wearables and fitness APIs
